Transcription of a PDF document to a LaTeX version.
Working with Jocelyne Blanc, for Pr. Annalisa Buffa, at EPFL.

The file "exercices.pdf" contains all the exercices, dedicated to the students.
The file "complet.pdf" contains both the exercices and the corrections. 


WARNING: Throughout the TeX files, I have used my own commands to have automatically sized adjustment for nested parentheses. The commands "parent", "abs", "norm", "triple", "bracket" and "squared" are all defined in the file "header.tex".
